# Dynamic-Time-warping
A MATLAB function to align two temporal sequences (ideally 3D accelerometer values) and compute the Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) distance. The alignment is for correcting the phase difference between the temporal sequences.

Main code: alignDTW.m
Input: The temporal sequences
Output: DTW distance
